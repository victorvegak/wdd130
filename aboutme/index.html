    <h2>Victor Manuel Vega</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone !! My name is Victor Vega, and I am from Nicaragua. I'm married with no children yet. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I have been able to have a closer relationship with our Heavenly Father. He has been helping me with all the challenges  I have been facing in my life. The things that I love about the church are Jesus Christ, the Prophets, the scriptures, the activities, and the members.
 </p>
 <p>Currently, I am a scheduling specialist; I schedule appointments with a gastroenterologist and help patients with the prep instructions for their procedures. Also, I have experience working as a tech support advisor; I have worked for Apple and Microsoft, providing support for their devices. I would say that my favorite job was when I worked with Microsoft; I supported Xbox consoles and games, and I had a lot of fun there. Playing video games is one of my hobbies now.
</p>
<p>
    I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in software development from BYU-Idaho. I want to support my family and become the first member of my family with a bachelor's degree.
